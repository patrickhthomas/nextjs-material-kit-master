                          Affirmative is a positive thinking app for IOS that emulates a physical deck of affirmation cards. In other words, itâ€™s a collection of positive statements presented in a playing card format that the user can then read, collect, and share. More importantly, Affirmative houses a growing library of resources committed to assisting those strugglings with a wide variety of mental health issues.

                          When it comes to the creative process, an uninterrupted workflow can mean the difference between a stroke of inspiration and starting at a blank page. Coop wants to provide an online platform that allows teams to remotely create, share, and collaborate on projects without having to lose momentum. In addition to conducting research and developing the designs necessary to implement this task, I was happy to be able to craft an identity that accurately reflects the vision of the stakeholders and users alike.
